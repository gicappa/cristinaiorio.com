### Increment 3: Payment Processing
- Integrate a secure payment processing feature that enables users to pay for their registration fees. This should provide multiple payment options and confirm successful transactions.

### Increment 4: Confirmation and Notifications
- After successful registration and payment, send confirmation emails to users. Implement a notification system to remind attendees of their upcoming events or any changes in the schedule.

### Increment 5: User Dashboard
- Create a user dashboard where attendees can view their registration details, event schedule, and any materials related to the conferences they are attending. This should also allow users to modify their registration if needed.

### Increment 6: Feedback Collection
